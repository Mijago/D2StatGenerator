# What is this?
This downloads all your PGCRs (Post Game Carnage Report) from the Bungie.net api and builds some graphs.

# How to Use?
3) Install all required packages
   1) `python -m pip install pandas plotly pathos requests`
4) Add your api key to `main.py`
5) Edit your user info in `main.py`
6) Run! `python3 main.py`
   1) May take a while. I need 45 seconds for 1000 PGCRs with a download speed of 4.5mb/s.
